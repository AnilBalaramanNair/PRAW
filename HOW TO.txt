    - client_secret
    - your Reddit username

6. You’ll use these in the Python script provided.
```

### 🧠 3. Prepare Your Python Script

> The script is provided in this repo as `reddit_comment_extractor.txt`  
> Open it and fill in your `client_id`, `client_secret`, `user_agent`, and the Reddit post URL.

📌 Save it as `reddit_comment_extractor.py` after editing.

---

### 🏃 4. Run the Script

Open terminal / CMD in the same folder and run:

```bash
python reddit_comment_extractor.py
```

After running, you'll see:

```
✅ Done! Comments saved to reddit_comments.xlsx
```

### 📁 5. Output

The script creates:

📄 **reddit_comments.xlsx**

Which contains:

| Username     | Upvotes | Comment                             |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| u/example123 | 145     | Cyberpunk 2077 deserves GOTY!        |
| u/[deleted]  | 20      | Using it for ML projects and Blender |

Use Excel filters or charts to analyze further.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- ❗ `ModuleNotFoundError`  
  → Run: `pip install praw pandas openpyxl`

- ❗ Reddit API auth error  
  → Ensure:
    - The app is type **script**
    - You used correct `client_id`, `client_secret`
    - The Reddit post is public

- ❗ Empty output  
  → Double-check the URL and make sure the post has visible comments
